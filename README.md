Make Youtube Great Again - fix its layout.

With some updates in April-May 2025 YouTube video cards are way too big, like for blind people. I didn't liked it, so this extension updates styles of video cards to the values you input. My default settings are:

- Num of videos in a row: `5`
- Num of shorts in a row: `7`
- Inline shorts: `checked`

Have fun!
